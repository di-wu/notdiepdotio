# notdiepdotio

Yay, time for a readme so we have at least a vague idea of what this repo is.

## The plan

The idea is to make a kind of game to play during lectures with friends, which we can modify (unlike others like curve fever etc).

The game should be vaguely like this, but of course items can change during development as needed.

*  Playable with multiple people on the same keyboard and/or with different laptops over internet
*  A clear start/end, not something which goes on forever (like agar.io, diep.io, etc)
*  Game itself can be anything, from top-down shooter to turn-based strategy
*  Game should be easily expandable though, so no tic-tac-toe or patience
*  Controls/UI can be unintuitive, since we'll be there to explain everything
*  No chat or communication of any kind needed since it is meant to be played together
*  Lots of RNG so the "best" player isn't guaranteed to win (and matches aren't repetitive)
